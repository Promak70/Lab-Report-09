                In 1970 Norman E. Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for a lifetime of work to feed a hungry
                world. Although a scientist with outstanding contributions, perhaps Dr. Borlaug's greatest achievement
                has been his unending struggle to integrate the various streams of agricultural research into viable
                technologies and to convince political leaders to bring these advances to fruition.
